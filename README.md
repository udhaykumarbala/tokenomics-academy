# Tokenomics Academy & Simulator

Tokenomics Academy is a fully‚Äëclient‚Äërendered learning platform built with Next.js 14 (App Router) that takes beginners from "zero to hero" in crypto‚Äëeconomic design. It combines bite-sized MDX lessons with an interactive simulator where users tweak supply, inflation, burn, staking, and governance parameters and watch token metrics evolve over time.

## Features

- üìö **Interactive Learning**: Bite-sized lessons on tokenomics fundamentals
- üîÑ **Real-time Simulator**: Experiment with token parameters and see immediate results
- üìä **Visualized Metrics**: Charts showing how token metrics evolve over time
- üì± **Fully Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- üåê **Client-side Only**: No server required, making it easy to deploy and fork

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/udhaykumarbala/tokenomics-simulator.git
   cd tokenomics-simulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

## Roadmap

- Add more comprehensive tokenomics models and simulations

## Why This Project

Current tokenomics articles are static. Readers struggle to grasp compounding inflation, burns, or vesting cliffs without a sandbox. This project provides a hands‚Äëon way to bridge theory and intuition while remaining 100% frontend‚Äëonly for easy deployment and forking.
