# Supply Dynamics

Supply dynamics refer to how a token's total supply changes over time, which directly influences its value proposition and economic behavior.

## Understanding Token Supply Models

Token supply models determine how many tokens exist and how that number changes over time:

- **Fixed Supply**: A capped maximum number of tokens (e.g., Bitcoin's 21 million limit)
- **Inflationary Supply**: New tokens are continuously created at a predefined rate
- **Deflationary Supply**: Tokens are systematically removed from circulation (burned)
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining elements of the above models with conditional mechanisms

## Emission Schedules

### Linear Emission

Linear emission releases tokens at a constant rate over time.

```
Year 1: 10,000,000 tokens
Year 2: 10,000,000 tokens
Year 3: 10,000,000 tokens
```

**Pros**: Predictable, easy to understand
**Cons**: Doesn't adapt to network growth or market conditions

### Exponential Decay

Exponential decay reduces the emission rate over time, often by a fixed percentage.

```
Year 1: 10,000,000 tokens
Year 2: 5,000,000 tokens
Year 3: 2,500,000 tokens
```

**Pros**: Frontloads incentives while becoming more scarce over time
**Cons**: May not provide sufficient long-term incentives

### Milestone-Based

Emissions tied to specific project milestones or achievements.

**Pros**: Aligns token distribution with project success
**Cons**: Potentially unpredictable, subject to project team discretion

## Token Burns

Token burning permanently removes tokens from circulation, creating deflationary pressure.

### Burn Mechanisms

- **Fee Burns**: A percentage of transaction fees is burned
- **Buy-Back and Burn**: Project revenue used to purchase and burn tokens
- **Burning on Usage**: Tokens consumed when using specific network functions

> **Case Study**: Binance's BNB conducts quarterly burns based on trading volume, aiming to eventually burn 50% of the total supply.

## Vesting and Lockups

### Vesting Schedules

Vesting gradually releases tokens to stakeholders over time:

- **Linear Vesting**: Equal portions released at regular intervals
- **Cliff Vesting**: No tokens released until a specific date, then either all at once or on a schedule
- **Milestone-Based Vesting**: Tokens released when specific project goals are achieved

### Importance of Vesting

Vesting mechanisms:

- Prevent immediate selling pressure
- Align long-term incentives of team and investors
- Signal commitment to the project's future
- Provide price stability during early project stages

## Impact on Token Value

Supply dynamics directly impact a token's value proposition:

| Supply Model | Typical Value Proposition | Example Projects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed | Store of Value | Bitcoin, Yearn Finance |
| Inflationary | Network Participation | Ethereum (pre-merge), Cosmos |
| Deflationary | Medium of Exchange | BNB, SafeMoon |
| Elastic | Price Stability | Ampleforth, BASE |

### Supply Elasticity

Some tokens implement elastic supply mechanisms that adjust based on market demand to target price stability:

- **Rebase Tokens**: Automatically adjust supply across all wallets to maintain price targets
- **Minting/Burning Mechanisms**: Create or destroy tokens based on algorithmic rules

## Simulating Supply Dynamics

When designing token supply dynamics, consider these key questions:

- What is the token's primary purpose? (Store of value, medium of exchange, governance, etc.)
- What initial distribution best supports your ecosystem growth?
- How will supply changes incentivize desired user behaviors?
- What emission schedule best balances short-term incentives with long-term sustainability?
