# Staking Mechanisms

Staking is the process of locking tokens in a cryptocurrency network to support its operations while earning rewards in return. It's a fundamental component of many modern tokenomic designs.

## What is Staking?

Staking serves multiple purposes in token economies:

- **Network Security**: Validators stake tokens as collateral, creating economic disincentives for malicious behavior
- **Governance Participation**: Staked tokens often grant voting rights in protocol decisions
- **Economic Alignment**: Rewards those who commit capital to the long-term success of the protocol
- **Supply Regulation**: Controls circulating supply by incentivizing holders to lock tokens

## Proof of Stake (PoS) Variations

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

In DPoS systems, token holders vote for a limited set of validators who secure the network.

**Examples**: EOS, Tron, Cosmos (variations)

**Pros**:
- Higher transaction throughput
- Lower barrier to participation for regular users
- Energy efficient

**Cons**:
- More centralized than other PoS systems
- Potential for validator collusion
- "Rich get richer" dynamics

### Bonded Proof of Stake

Validators and delegators lock (bond) their tokens as collateral, subject to slashing if they misbehave.

**Examples**: Cosmos, Polkadot, Ethereum 2.0

**Key features**:
- Unbonding periods (typically 7-28 days)
- Slashing conditions for protocol violations
- Delegation mechanisms

### Liquid Staking

Liquid staking allows users to stake tokens while receiving a liquid representation that can be used elsewhere in the ecosystem.

**Examples**: Lido (stETH), Marinade (mSOL)

**Benefits**:
- Maintains liquidity of staked assets
- Enables capital efficiency
- Allows participation in DeFi while staking

> **Important**: Liquid staking derivatives create new systemic risks and dependencies between protocols.

## Staking Economics

### Reward Mechanisms

Staking rewards typically come from:

1. **Inflation**: New tokens created as rewards (inflationary)
2. **Transaction Fees**: A portion of network fees distributed to stakers
3. **Protocol Revenue**: Other revenue streams the protocol generates

### Calculating Staking APR/APY

The basic formula for annual percentage rate (APR) in a staking system is:

```
Annual Rewards = (Total Rewards per Year / Total Tokens Staked) * 100%
```

Factors affecting staking returns:

- **Staking Ratio**: Percentage of total supply that is staked
- **Inflation Rate**: Rate at which new tokens are created
- **Token Price**: Market value of the token (impacts real returns)
- **Lockup Period**: Duration tokens must remain staked

## Staking and Tokenomics

### Impact on Circulating Supply

Staking effectively reduces circulating supply by:
- Locking tokens for defined periods
- Creating opportunity costs for token holders
- Reducing sell pressure

### Equilibrium Staking Rate

Most protocols aim for an equilibrium staking rate where:

- Enough tokens are staked to secure the network
- Sufficient tokens remain in circulation for liquidity
- Rewards are attractive but sustainable

Factors influencing this equilibrium:
- Reward rate
- Lockup requirements
- Alternative uses for the token
- Risk perception

## Slashing and Security

Slashing is the mechanism by which validators lose a portion of their staked tokens if they act maliciously or fail to perform their duties.

### Common Slashing Conditions

- **Double signing**: Validating conflicting blocks
- **Downtime**: Failing to participate in consensus for extended periods
- **Malicious behavior**: Attempting to attack or subvert the network

### Slashing Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity | Percentage of stake slashed | 0.1-100% |
| Jailing Time | Period validator cannot participate | 1-14 days |
| Evidence Window | Time to submit proof of violation | 1 hour - 2 weeks |

## Advanced Staking Concepts

### Nomination Pools

Allow smaller token holders to pool resources to meet minimum staking requirements.

**Examples**: Polkadot, Kusama

### Superfluid Staking

Tokens staked for security can simultaneously provide liquidity or other utility.

**Examples**: Osmosis, THORChain (variations)

### Restaking and EigenLayer

Restaking allows the same staked ETH to secure multiple protocols, amplifying capital efficiency but also increasing systemic risk.

## Designing Effective Staking Mechanisms

When designing staking for your token, consider:

1. **Security vs Decentralization**: Higher returns may increase staking ratio but concentrate tokens
2. **Lockup Periods**: Longer periods increase security but reduce liquidity
3. **Minimum Stake**: Lower minimums increase participation but may reduce validator quality
4. **Reward Distribution**: Equal distribution vs. proportional to stake amount
