# Tokenomic Patterns

Tokenomic patterns are proven templates for token economics that address specific use cases or value propositions. Understanding these patterns can help you design more effective token systems.

## Why Study Tokenomic Patterns?

Like design patterns in software engineering, tokenomic patterns:

- **Provide Tested Solutions**: Based on real-world implementations that have proven successful
- **Create Common Language**: Help teams communicate complex economic systems
- **Avoid Common Pitfalls**: Learn from mistakes that others have already made
- **Accelerate Design**: Start with a pattern and customize, rather than designing from scratch

## Core Tokenomic Patterns

### 1. Work Token Model

In this pattern, tokens represent the right to provide services to the network and earn fees.

**Key characteristics**:
- Tokens must be staked to perform work
- Work quality is incentivized through stake slashing
- Rewards come from fees, not inflation

**Examples**: Keep Network, Livepeer, The Graph

> **Case Study**: Livepeer requires video transcoding providers to stake tokens, with rewards distributed based on work performed and penalties for poor service.

### 2. Usage Token / Payment Token

Tokens are used directly as payment for services within the ecosystem.

**Key characteristics**:
- Value tied to demand for network services
- Often include burn mechanisms to create deflationary pressure
- May offer discounts compared to fiat payment options

**Examples**: BNB, FIL, RNDR

### 3. Governance Token

Primary value comes from the right to participate in protocol decision-making.

**Key characteristics**:
- Voting rights on protocol changes
- Often paired with fee-sharing mechanisms
- Value derives from future protocol revenue/growth expectations

**Examples**: UNI, COMP, AAVE

### 4. Discount Token

Tokens provide fee discounts when using platform services.

**Key characteristics**:
- Creates strong buy pressure when platform usage grows
- Incentivizes long-term holding for frequent users
- Often combined with other utility

**Examples**: BNB, CRO, FTT (historical)

### 5. Seigniorage Shares

A multi-token system designed to maintain a stablecoin peg.

**Key characteristics**:
- Separate tokens for stability and growth
- Algorithmic expansion and contraction
- Incentives aligned with maintaining peg

**Examples**: Basis (original design), Empty Set Dollar, Frax (modified version)

## Hybrid Models and Innovations

### Multi-Token Ecosystems

Many projects use multiple tokens with specialized functions:

**Examples**:
- MakerDAO: DAI (stablecoin) and MKR (governance)
- Curve: CRV (governance) and various liquidity tokens
- Axie Infinity: AXS (governance) and SLP (in-game rewards)

### Vetoken Model (Vote Escrow)

Tokens locked for governance gain multiplied voting power based on lock duration.

**Key characteristics**:
- Longer locks = more governance power
- Aligns incentives for long-term thinking
- Often includes boosted rewards based on lock time

**Examples**: Curve (veCRV), Balancer (veBAL), Frax (veFXS)

### Rage Quit and Moloch Models

DAO patterns that protect minority stakeholders by allowing them to exit with their fair share of assets if they disagree with a decision.

**Examples**: MolochDAO, DAOhaus

## Tokenomic Anti-Patterns

### Infinite Supply Without Utility

Tokens with unlimited supply and insufficient burn mechanisms or utility typically fail.

**Warning signs**:
- High inflation with no corresponding value creation
- Rewards solely from new token issuance
- Lack of sustainable use cases

### Ponzinomics

Models that rely primarily on new entrants buying tokens to pay returns to earlier participants.

**Warning signs**:
- Marketing focused on APY rather than utility
- Returns dependent on token price appreciation
- Excessive referral rewards

### Complexity Without Purpose

Over-engineered token systems that users and investors can't understand.

**Warning signs**:
- Multiple interconnected tokens without clear purposes
- Convoluted mechanics that obscure economic flows
- Frequent mechanic changes to "fix" price action

## Industry-Specific Patterns

### DeFi Token Patterns

- **Protocol Owned Liquidity**: Protocols own their own trading liquidity (e.g., Olympus DAO)
- **Liquidity Mining**: Token rewards for providing liquidity (e.g., Compound, Uniswap)
- **Lending Platforms**: Collateralized loans with interest sharing (e.g., Aave, Compound)

### GameFi Token Patterns

- **Dual-Token Model**: Separating governance and in-game currency (e.g., Axie Infinity)
- **Play-to-Earn**: Rewarding gameplay with tokens (e.g., StepN, Thetan Arena)
- **NFT + Utility Token**: NFTs representing assets, tokens for actions (e.g., Gods Unchained)

### DAO Token Patterns

- **Contribution Mining**: Tokens earned through work contributions (e.g., GitcoinDAO)
- **Reputation Systems**: Non-transferable influence based on contributions (e.g., DAOstack)
- **Investment DAOs**: Pooling capital with shared governance (e.g., MetaCartel Ventures)

## Designing With Patterns

When designing a token economy, consider:

1. **Start With Use Case**: Select patterns that match your core value proposition
2. **Mix and Match**: Combine elements from different patterns as needed
3. **Simplify**: Only add complexity when it serves a clear purpose
4. **Test and Iterate**: Simulate different scenarios before implementation
5. **Consider All Stakeholders**: Ensure incentives align for all ecosystem participants

## Evaluating Tokenomic Patterns

When evaluating a token design, ask:

- Is there sustainable value accrual?
- Are incentives aligned for all participants?
- Is the model resilient to market downturns?
- Does it solve a real economic problem?
- Are supply and demand mechanics balanced?
